## Pong-Made-In-Python
A project where I followed a tutorial on how to make Pong in Python

This project was made following a number of tutorials and used an image for the background of my project. 
There is much that could have been done to improve it like not calling a bunch of global variables and instead creating a class
but to be honest trying to do that was out of my wheelhouse (FOR NOW!)
This code will run and will create a rudimentary version of pong that runs forever until you x out of the window.
Enjoy!
